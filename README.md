# openbgi-hl
Open realization of KiraKira script interpreter.

Just an experimental project, running "high-level" scripts of KiraKira visual novel. Original BGI engine is working with "low-level" script which itself interpret "high-level" scripts.
Or at least I think so.

Project is pretty much abandoned, just don't want it to be completely lost.

Needs bode::blocks, SDL 1.2 and SDL_ttf to compile and KiraKira resource files to run.
