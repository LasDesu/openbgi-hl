Open realization of KiraKira script interpreter.
Just an experiment project, running "high-level" scripts of KiraKira visual novel. Real BGI engine is working with "low-level" script witch itself interpret "high-level" scripts.
Or at least I think so.

Project is pretty much abandoned. Just don't want it to be completely lost.
Needs CodeBlocks and SDL 1.2 to compile and KiraKira resource files to run.
